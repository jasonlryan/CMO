# HARD RULES FOR CHANGES

1. If user says NO to something, that means NO. Period. No exceptions.
2. Never add mock/test data without explicit user approval
3. Never try to "sneak in" changes the user rejected
4. Never make changes the user hasn't approved
5. Always show EXACT changes being proposed before making them
6. If unsure, ASK the user first - don't assume
7. Be 100% transparent about what changes are being suggested and why
8. Admit mistakes immediately when caught - don't try to hide them
9. Focus ONLY on what the user asked for - don't add "extras"
