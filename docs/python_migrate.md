Below is an outline of how to migrate your current Python functionality (currently in main.py) to Node.js for deployment on Vercel. In your case, main.py only does two things: it verifies that required environment variables exist and then initializes a Supabase client. Since Vercel only supports Node.js (and similar runtimes), you’ll need to re‐implement these steps in JavaScript. Here’s how you can do it:

1. Create a Node.js Entry Point
   Create a new file (for example, backend/index.js) to replace main.py. This file will load environment variables, validate them, and initialize the Supabase client.

Example backend/index.js:
js
Copy
// Load environment variables from .env
require('dotenv').config();

const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js');

// List the required environment variables
const requiredEnvVars = ['OPENAI_API_KEY', 'SUPABASE_URL', 'SUPABASE_KEY'];

// Check for missing variables and throw an error if any are missing
const missingVars = requiredEnvVars.filter(varName => !process.env[varName]);
if (missingVars.length > 0) {
throw new Error(`Missing required environment variables: ${missingVars.join(', ')}`);
}

// Initialize the Supabase client
const supabase = createClient(process.env.SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SUPABASE_KEY);

// Optionally export the Supabase client for use in other modules
module.exports = { supabase };

// If you eventually plan to add server routes (e.g., using Express or Fastify), you can do so here.
// For now, if this is just for configuration and used by other services, no server startup code is needed. 2. Update Your Project Scripts
Since main.py is no longer needed, update your package.json (or your deployment configuration) to use your new Node.js entry point. For example, you might change your start command to run node backend/index.js if you ever need to run this file directly.

Example package.json snippet:
json
Copy
{
"scripts": {
"test": "node backend/tests/test.js",
"start": "node backend/index.js",
"dev:frontend": "cd frontend && npm run dev"
}
} 3. Remove Python-Specific Files
Since you’re moving entirely to Node.js:

You can remove main.py from your repository.
Ensure any references to Python (or its packages) are removed from your project dependencies. 4. Adjust Any Other Dependencies
If other parts of your project (for example, the assessment services) relied on main.py for environment configuration or Supabase initialization, update those modules to require the new backend/index.js (or a separate configuration module) so that they use the Node.js–based Supabase client.

For example, in backend/services/supabase.js, you might change:

js
Copy
// Instead of creating a client here again, you can import the already-configured client:
const { supabase } = require("../index");
Alternatively, if you prefer to keep it self-contained, you can duplicate the logic from index.js there. The key point is to use Node.js instead of Python.

5. Testing on Vercel
   Before deployment:

Run your local tests (e.g., via npm run test) to ensure that everything works with the new Node.js configuration.
Use vercel dev to test your deployment locally in a Vercel-like environment.
Summary
main.py is replaced by a new Node.js file (e.g., backend/index.js) that:
Loads environment variables with dotenv
Checks for required environment variables and throws an error if any are missing
Initializes the Supabase client using @supabase/supabase-js
Optionally exports the client for use by other modules
Update your package.json scripts and remove Python-specific files.
Test locally and then deploy to Vercel.
This approach ensures that all your backend functionality runs in a Node.js environment compatible with Vercel while maintaining the same environment validation and Supabase initialization logic as before.
