# CMO Assessment Tool Implementation Plan

January 27, 2024

## Executive Summary

The audit reveals that while our CMO Assessment Tool has strong foundations in basic skill assessment and maturity staging, it needs enhancement to fully support the consolidated framework - particularly around investor-focused abilities, AI readiness, and the separation of leadership and commercial acumen as distinct skill clusters.
