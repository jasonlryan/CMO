- Stage-specific weighting system
- Database structure
- Report generation
- Basic maturity stage model

üöß Partially Implemented:

- Four-level skill depth framework
- Maturity stage alignment

‚ùå Missing:

- Investor-focused abilities
- AI readiness assessment

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core System (COMPLETED)

- ‚úÖ Basic service structure
- ‚úÖ OpenAI integration
- ‚úÖ Logging system
- ‚úÖ Basic validation

### Phase 2: Validation & Testing (CURRENT)

- Test coverage for core services
- Validation of OpenAI responses
- Error handling improvements
- Performance benchmarking

### Phase 3: Documentation & Standards

- API documentation
- Usage examples
- Error codes catalog
- Performance guidelines

### Phase 4: Production Readiness

- Security review
- Rate limiting
- Error recovery
- Monitoring setup

## Non-Critical Enhancements
