- **Should Have**: Important features that add significant value
- **Could Have**: Features that would enhance the system but aren't critical
- **Won't Have**: Features explicitly excluded from current scope (to be documented separately)

Requirements will be regularly reviewed and may be reprioritized based on:

- User feedback
- Technical constraints
- Business requirements
- Market conditions

Detailed implementation timelines will be developed once requirements are finalized and approved.
