Speaker: "Okay, absolutely. Let me start: Building a Team from Scratch—Initial Priorities."

[0:13]
Speaker: "I love what you're doing. Although I’m a senior leader, I never stop learning. Today, I share my view and experiences."

[0:33]
Speaker: "When building a team, the first question is: Who should be your first hire? In my early days, I might have chosen a content person or all-rounder, but now it depends on the company's objectives."

[1:27]
Speaker: "I get asked often about the first hire. It all starts with an audit of the current marketing function—identifying what’s working, what’s missing, and aligning with the company’s goals."

[3:53]
Speaker: "In the audit, I look at past marketing efforts, compare competitor strategies, and examine company goals, such as funding needs. For example, a company needing more brand awareness might benefit more from a PR hire than a digital marketer."

[5:27]
Speaker: "The audit reveals specific needs, informing who to hire. I’ve learned that the right hire depends on the business’s current challenges rather than a one-size-fits-all approach."

[5:51]
Speaker: "Hiring for potential is crucial—I look for people who can learn, adapt, and eventually grow into leadership roles, rather than just relying on past experience."

[6:27]
Speaker: "I once hired based on traditional roles, but the real need was for someone versatile who could adapt to evolving challenges; that mistake taught me the importance of tailoring hires to the actual needs."

[7:25]
Speaker: "After the audit, I propose a team structure aligned with the company’s long-term goals, clearly defining roles and responsibilities so everyone knows what they own."

[10:20]
Speaker: "In startups or scale-ups, it's vital to hire people who can wear multiple hats and drive the team forward quickly."

[12:33]
Speaker: "I emphasize collaboration: instead of working in silos, the team should work together to solve problems, ensuring that every department—especially marketing and sales—aligns toward common goals."

[15:24]
Speaker: "A key part of my strategy is fostering a culture of recognition and continuous learning. I use practices like sharing both successes and mistakes (sometimes humorously called 'fuck up Fridays') to encourage transparency and growth."

[18:00]
Speaker: "Aligning marketing with sales is critical. Early on, I build strong relationships with sales and finance teams so that marketing efforts are directly tied to revenue goals."

[20:54]
Speaker: "Retention comes from understanding each team member’s values and growth aspirations. I focus on one-to-one conversations that go beyond work tasks to discuss personal development and career goals."

[24:31]
Speaker: "Ultimately, building a team is about adapting to the specific challenges of the business. It requires a data-driven audit, a tailored hiring strategy, and a collaborative culture that values continuous learning and open communication."

[26:25]
Speaker: "I conclude by emphasizing that leadership isn’t just about having all the answers—it's about equipping your team with the tools to succeed and being open to learning from everyone around you."
