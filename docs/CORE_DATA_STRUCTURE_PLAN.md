## Objective

Implement separate skill clusters for leadership and commercial acumen, while adding support for investor-focused abilities and AI readiness assessment.

## Current Structure

From assessment.ts:

- Enhanced skill categories ✅
- Multi-level skill depth ✅
- Evidence-based assessment ✅
- Contextual notes ✅

## Data Flow Status

### 1. Prompt → AI Response ✅

- Structured JSON output
- Skill categorization
- Evidence collection
- Assessment notes

### 2. AI → Profile Processing ✅

- Type validation
- Data transformation
- Error handling
- Field mapping

### 3. Profile → Report Generation 🚧

- Basic structure working
- Template functions defined
- Types aligned
- Need to complete:
  - Capability analysis integration
  - Evidence analysis formatting
  - Assessment notes structure

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed

1. Type Definitions

   - Created skill type definitions
   - Updated CMOProfile interface
   - Added capability types
   - Added evidence/notes types

2. Prompt Engineering

   - Updated assessment criteria
   - Added new skill categories
   - Enhanced JSON structure
   - Added validation rules

3. OpenAI Integration
   - Improved error handling
   - Added JSON validation
   - Fixed parsing issues
   - Added debug mode control
   - Enhanced logging system

### 🚧 In Progress

1. Report Generation

   - Basic structure working
   - Need to integrate:

   - Logging control system ✅

### ⏱️ Next Steps

1. Complete Report Generation

   - Integrate capability analysis ✅
   - Format evidence analysis ✅
   - Structure assessment notes ✅
   - Enhance error handling ��
   - Improve debug visibility ✅

2. Enhance Testing

   - Add validation tests 🚧
   - Verify scoring accuracy 🚧
   - Test error handling 🚧
   - Debug mode testing ✅
   - Log control testing ✅

3. Plan Database Migration
   - Design schema updates
   - Create migration scripts
   - Test data transformation
   - Add logging tables
   - Debug flag storage

## Success Criteria

1. Technical Requirements

   - Zero TypeScript errors
   - All tests passing
   - Clean data structure
   - Efficient processing
   - Effective debug system
   - Controlled logging output

2. Business Requirements
   - Accurate skill assessment
   - Proper categorization
   - Valid scoring
   - Useful reporting

## Notes

- Keep JavaScript/TypeScript compatibility in mind
- Database integration will be handled as a separate phase
- Focus on robust error handling in OpenAI integration
- Maintain strict JSON validation

## Data Structure Updates

1. Evidence Collection

   - Flexible structure for strengths and examples
   - No limit on number of examples
   - Rich context for development areas
   - Free-form key-value pairs for both strengths and development areas

2. Assessment Notes
   - Unrestricted array of red flags
   - Open-ended follow-up topics
   - Free-form leadership style narrative
