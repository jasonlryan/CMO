Outline the Jason structure and create the document please. 
Look at the depth levels. Plan and tell me what's next
OK. Look at the transcript analysis markdown file which contains the prompt and tell me how it needs to be updated. 
Show me how the prompt needs to be updated
This isn't what I want. I've already set up a new branch called V3 and I've pushed the whole code base to it. I just want to check whether the local code base and the new branch V3 are In Sync. That's all. 
There must be a simpler way to just check if they're In Sync. 
Now look at the orchestration which is done in assessment.Js and the scoring which is done in scoring.Js. And let me know what the next steps are. 
So looking at orchestration I can see that we create profile in assessment dot JS which suggests that we need to update the template in CMO profile dot JS can you confirm that? 
OK, so we've looked at the CMO profile template. There's also the two reporting templates which are in reports dot JS. Can you ensure that they are updated please
Do we have everything we need now to update scoring dot JS?
Create a backup to scoring JS before we start this because it's quite a big change.
Go ahead and make the scoring dot JS changes please
Can you ensure that this? The scoring JS now is past the right information from profile Cmoprofile.Js. And that everything is in place for its generate reports
