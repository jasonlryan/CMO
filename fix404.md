# Fixing 404 Errors on Vercel Deployment

## Complete Solution

I've implemented a comprehensive fix for the 404 errors on Vercel. Here's what was done:

1. **Simplified the `vercel.json` configuration**:

   - Using a single build for the Node.js server (`vercel.js`)
   - Setting up a single catch-all route that directs all traffic to the `vercel.js` handler
   - Adding `buildCommand` to explicitly use the root package.json build script
   - Specifying the correct output directory for the frontend

2. **Added/verified environment configuration**:

   - Created `frontend/.env` with `VITE_API_URL=/api` to ensure the frontend connects to the API correctly

3. **Leveraged the existing robust `vercel.js` file**, which:

   - Handles API requests to backend endpoints
   - Serves static frontend files
   - Provides fallback to index.html for client-side routing
   - Contains extensive error handling and logging

4. **Added a local testing script**:
   - Added `build:local` script to package.json to test the exact same build and server setup locally

## Why This Works

The key insight was to leverage the existing `vercel.js` file which already had excellent path resolution logic and error handling. By simplifying the Vercel configuration to use this single entry point, we:

1. Eliminated conflicting route definitions
2. Ensured consistent handling of all request types
3. Properly connected the frontend and backend
4. Maintained the SPA routing behavior

The `vercel.js` handler automatically:

- Routes `/api/*` requests to the backend
- Serves static files from `frontend/dist`
- Falls back to `index.html` for client-side routing

## Local Testing Before Deployment

To test the exact same setup locally before deploying to Vercel:

1. Run the local build and server:

   ```
   npm run build:local
   ```

2. This will:

   - Build the frontend with Vite
   - Start the vercel.js server in production mode
   - Serve the application at http://localhost:3000

3. Verify that:
   - The main application loads correctly
   - API endpoints are accessible
   - Client-side routing works (navigating to different views)
   - Assets are properly loaded

This local testing ensures your Vercel deployment will work correctly before you push changes.

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy this fix:

1. Ensure all files are committed:

   - Updated `vercel.json`
   - New or updated `frontend/.env`

2. Deploy to Vercel using:

   ```
   vercel --prod
   ```

   Or use the GitHub integration

3. Verify in the Vercel logs that:
   - The build process completes successfully
   - The server initialization shows the correct path resolution
   - Requests are being handled properly

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check Vercel build logs for any errors
2. Examine the Function Logs in the Vercel dashboard for runtime errors
3. Verify environment variables are correctly set in the Vercel dashboard
4. If necessary, add more detailed logging in `vercel.js`
